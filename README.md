# This is my first time typing a game. Its a simple classic snake game. If you want to play it without downloading use this link: https://replit.com/@AngelGyu/snake#main.py
On the Replit run the main.py. When the window opens, resize it so you can see the whole window of the game. If you download it you just run the main.py.
